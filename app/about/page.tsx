            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Tree adoption at Joyland supports the land as a living system — an ecology where each part works together to harmonize the whole.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Your yearly contribution allows time, care, and continuity: the conditions needed for soil to regenerate, biodiversity to return, and trees to be tended according to their natural rhythm. Everything described here is made possible by your support — from groundcover and insects to hand harvesting, fresh oil, and ongoing observation of the land.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              What follows is a living process, shaped season by season, tree by tree.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-serif text-gray-800 mb-4">The Land Today</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Joyland demonstrates what becomes possible when nature is given space to establish on its own strength, building resilience over time.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              What was once bare clay now carries living groundcover. Flowers rise and return each year. Insects move through the grove for longer periods across the seasons. Summer hums with crickets throughout the day, while mornings and evenings bring softer light, humidity, and the sound of frogs. Spring fills the land with birdsong; winter arrives quietly, wrapped in mist, with rosemary and calendula still flowering well into January.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Each season leaves a visible trace — in soil texture, plant diversity, moisture retention, and the way the land holds life.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-serif text-gray-800 mb-4">Natural Succession in Motion</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Succession accelerated quickly once space and support were present.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Organic matter remained on the land. Hay was spread in selected areas. Pioneer plants arrived first — amaranth, thistles, rockets, bur clover — followed by fennel, wild carrots, and other self-seeding species. Hay-supported areas produced abundant calendula and chamomile. Cooler, shaded zones welcomed lamiums and perennial clovers, laying foundations for long-term groundcover.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Over the past year, a wide range of seeds were introduced to expand diversity: oregano, borage, wild sages, cornflower, poppies, St John’s wort, valerian, and more. Each spring reveals what the land chooses to carry forward.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              A compost heap tailored to olive tree needs now returns nutrients to the soil in a slow, circular system.

              Succession here unfolds through plants, roots, and soil — building structure and fertility over time.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-serif text-gray-800 mb-4">Groundcover, Soil Health & Water Retention</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Groundcover reshapes the land from the ground up.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Living cover allows water to penetrate deeper into clay soil, supports organic matter buildup, and encourages microbial and bacterial life, while attracting beneficial biodiversity. Roots move freely through soil that becomes softer and more structured over time.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Established olive and almond trees benefit directly from this process. As plants complete their life cycle, they return organic matter to the soil, strengthening fertility year after year.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              As habitat strengthens, animal life responds.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Ants, beetles, bees, wasps, and butterflies shape daily rhythms in the grove. Ants garden continuously — moving seeds, aerating soil, and improving water infiltration. Pollinators concentrate around flowering periods, creating dense moments of activity.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Birds, mammals, and reptiles move freely through the unfenced land. Deer, hare, foxes, wild boar, and jackals contribute to soil structure and seed dispersal. Lizards and snakes warm themselves on stone terraces.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">

              Your support allows trees to be cared for individually.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Each tree is observed and tended according to its rhythm — balancing canopy, shade, airflow, and long-term health. Olive trees thrive with layered protection, while almond trees receive adjusted care as groundcover strengthens across the land.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Some years focus on fruit, others on growth and recovery. Stewardship adapts continuously, guided by what the trees communicate.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Harvesting reflects the size and nature of the grove.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Smaller trees are harvested by hand. Larger trees are worked with manual or small electric tools. Harvested olives move immediately into shaded storage, layered carefully, and transported to the mill within a narrow time window.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Multiple passes support the quality and logistics of a small grove. Small-batch production keeps attention present at every step — from tree to pressing.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Joyland olive oil is pressed fresh and left unfiltered.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              This preserves the olive’s active compounds — polyphenols, antioxidants, and aromatic elements — resulting in a vibrant, expressive oil shaped by the harvest moment. Time is used carefully, allowing quality to remain intact.
            </p>
